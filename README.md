Distrubuted utilization script for BlueCenter

Framework that takes a file representing a utilization and on/off schedule for the bluecenter and runs the servers at such a schedule.

This framework should be paired with daemons to read temperature (via IPMITools) and power usage (via SNMP from the Server Power Manager [SPM]) in the datacenter.
